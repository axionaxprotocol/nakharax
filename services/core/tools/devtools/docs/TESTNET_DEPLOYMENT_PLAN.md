# nakharax Testnet Deployment Plan
**Date**: November 13, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 1 In Progress (78% Complete)  
**VPS**: vmi2895217 (217.216.109.5)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Current infrastructure is 78% deployed (7/9 services operational) with MetaMask wallet integration successfully implemented. The existing VPS is suitable for testnet infrastructure services but not adequate for validator node operations due to resource constraints.

**Recommended Approach**: Hybrid deployment strategy focusing on completing current infrastructure while preparing separate validator node deployment.

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy: Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Complete Infrastructure (Immediate - 1-2 Days) ⚡

**Priority 1: Fix Remaining Services**
- [ ] Debug and fix Explorer API (Port 3001)
  - Check RPC connection configuration
  - Verify database connectivity
  - Review container logs: `docker logs nakharax-explorer-backend` (or `nakharax-explorer-api` in dev)
  - Test: `curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/health`
  - **If the image is missing or not starting:** use the stub from the repo — `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d explorer-api` (build from `tools/devtools/Dockerfile.explorer`)

- [ ] Debug and fix Faucet API (Port 3002)
  - Verify wallet/key: must set `FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY` (hex 32 bytes)
  - Check RPC integration and env `RPC_URL`, `PORT=3002`
  - Test: `curl -s http://localhost:3002/health`
  - **Build from source:** use `ops/deploy/Dockerfile.faucet` with build context = `core/` (see [TESTNET_READINESS.md](../../../TESTNET_READINESS.md))

**Priority 2: End-to-End Testing**
- [ ] MetaMask wallet connection flow
- [ ] Network auto-configuration (Chain ID 86137)
