# AxionAx Testnet Readiness Checker

**Comprehensive pre-launch validation for AxionAx Protocol testnet deployment**

## 📋 Overview

The Testnet Readiness Checker is an automated validation tool that performs comprehensive checks across 7 critical categories to ensure the AxionAx Protocol is ready for testnet launch. It validates infrastructure, security, performance, documentation, deployment configurations, and monitoring setup.

## 🎯 Purpose

Before launching a public testnet, it's essential to verify that:
- ✅ All critical security requirements are met
- ✅ Infrastructure is properly configured
- ✅ Code quality meets production standards
- ✅ Documentation is complete for validators and developers
- ✅ Deployment automation is in place
- ✅ Monitoring and observability are configured

This tool automates these checks and provides a clear pass/fail report.

## 🚀 Quick Start

| 70-74 | C+ | Acceptable ✅ |
| 65-69 | C | Below Threshold |
| 60-64 | D | Poor |
| <60 | F | Fail ❌ |

### Pass Criteria
To pass the readiness check:
1. ✅ **Overall score ≥ 70/100**
2. ✅ **All critical checks passed** (security)

📋 RECOMMENDATIONS:
  ❌ Complete the following before testnet:
  • Fix 2 critical security issues
  • Improve overall score from 50.0 to 70+
  • Review failed checks and address root causes
  • Re-run readiness checker after fixes
```

## 🛠️ Fixing Common Issues

### Critical Issue: Hardcoded Secrets
**Problem**: Found potential secrets in code
```
❌ No Hardcoded Secrets: Found 3 potential secrets
```

**Solution**:
1. Run `git grep -i "password\|api_key\|secret\|token"`
2. Move secrets to `.env` files
3. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
4. Use environment variables or config files
5. Re-run checker

### Critical Issue: No Security Audit
**Problem**: Missing security audit report
```
❌ Security Audit Status: No security audit report found
```

**Solution**:
1. Contact security audit firm (Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, etc.)
2. Schedule penetration testing
3. Create `SECURITY_AUDIT.md` or `AUDIT_REPORT.md`
4. Document findings and remediations

### High Priority: Build Failures
**Problem**: Builds not completing successfully
```
⚠️ Build Success: 0/3 builds successful
```

**Solution**:
1. Check `cargo build --release` for Rust
2. Check `npm run build` for TypeScript projects
3. Verify dependencies are installed
4. Check for compilation errors in logs

### Medium Priority: Missing Monitoring
**Problem**: No metrics or health endpoints
```
⚠️ Metrics Collection: No metrics configuration
```

**Solution**:
1. Add Prometheus metrics endpoint
2. Configure Grafana dashboards
3. Implement `/health` endpoint in RPC server
4. Set up Netdata or similar monitoring

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Checker Won't Run
```bash
# Check Python version (requires 3.8+)
python --version

# Install missing dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify script location
ls nakhara-devtools/scripts/testing/testnet_readiness_checker.py
```

### False Positives
Some checks may show false positives (e.g., development secrets in comments). Review the JSON report for details:
```bash
cat TESTNET_READINESS_REPORT.json | jq '.results[] | select(.passed == false)'
```

### Custom Checks
Extend the checker by adding custom validation in `testnet_readiness_checker.py`:
```python
def _check_custom_requirement(self):
    """Add custom validation logic"""
    # Your check implementation
    return passed, score, message, details
```

## 📊 Historical Tracking

Track progress over time:
```bash
# Save report with timestamp
cp TESTNET_READINESS_REPORT.json reports/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).json

# Compare scores
python scripts/compare_readiness_reports.py reports/
```
