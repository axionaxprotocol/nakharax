## Pre-Audit Checklist

Before engaging audit firm:

- [x] Code freeze on core protocol
- [x] Complete unit test coverage
- [x] Integration tests passing
- [x] Documentation complete
- [ ] **Engage audit firm** (PENDING)
- [ ] Provide technical documentation
- [ ] Set up communication channels
- [ ] Allocate budget ($40,000 - $100,000)

---

## Audit Methodology

Expected audit procedures:

### 1. Manual Code Review
- Line-by-line review of critical components
- Architecture analysis
- Logic flaw detection
- Best practices compliance

### 2. Automated Analysis
- Static analysis tools (Clippy, cargo-audit)
- Fuzzing (cargo-fuzz, AFL)
- Formal verification (where applicable)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### 3. Dynamic Testing
- Penetration testing
- Network stress testing
- Attack simulation
- Performance profiling under load

### 4. Cryptographic Review
- Implementation correctness
- Side-channel attack resistance
- Randomness quality
- Key management security

---

## Known Issues (Pre-Audit)

### Addressed
✅ No hardcoded secrets in production code  
✅ Dependencies up to date  
✅ Linting rules enforced  
✅ Unit tests passing (42/42)  

### To Address
⚠️ **Pending formal security audit**  
⚠️ Load testing under extreme conditions  
⚠️ Economic attack vector analysis  
⚠️ Long-term consensus security proofs  

---

## Vulnerability Classification

Findings will be categorized as:

### Critical
- Direct loss of funds
- Consensus failure
- Network halt
- Unauthorized state changes

### High
- Significant security impact
- Denial of service
- Information disclosure
- Authorization bypass

### Medium
- Limited security impact
- Performance degradation
- Non-critical logic errors

### Low
- Minor issues
- Code quality concerns
- Documentation gaps

### Informational
- Best practice recommendations
- Optimization suggestions

---

## Remediation Process

Upon receiving audit report:

1. **Immediate** (Critical/High)
   - Fix within 48 hours
   - Emergency team meeting
   - Re-audit of fixes

2. **Short-term** (Medium)
   - Fix within 1 week
   - Include in next release
   - Verification testing

3. **Long-term** (Low/Informational)
   - Plan for future releases
   - Technical debt tracking
   - Continuous improvement

---

## Post-Audit Actions

After audit completion:

- [ ] Review all findings
- [ ] Implement all critical/high fixes
- [ ] Re-audit critical changes
- [ ] Publish audit report (public transparency)
- [ ] Update security documentation
- [ ] Communicate findings to community
- [ ] Implement recommended improvements

---

## Interim Security Measures

Until professional audit is completed:

### Internal Security Review ✅
- [x] Code review by senior developers
- [x] Automated security scanning (Snyk)
- [x] Dependency vulnerability checks
- [x] No hardcoded secrets verification

### Bug Bounty Program (Planned)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE ⚠️**

**This template does NOT constitute a security audit. A professional third-party security audit by a reputable firm (Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, ConsenSys Diligence, etc.) is REQUIRED before mainnet launch and STRONGLY RECOMMENDED before public testnet launch.**

**Timeline: Professional audit should be scheduled IMMEDIATELY for completion before testnet Q1 2026.**
