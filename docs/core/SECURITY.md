## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **nakharax-monolith** (blockchain core, node, RPC, DeAI worker, ops/deploy, or tooling), please report it responsibly.

**Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive findings.

1. **Email:** Send details to the maintainers (e.g. via the contact listed on [nakharaxx.io](https://nakharaxx.io) or the organization profile).
2. **Include:** Description of the issue, steps to reproduce, impact, and suggested fix if any.
3. **Response:** We aim to acknowledge within 72 hours and will work with you on a fix and disclosure timeline.

We appreciate your help in keeping the protocol and its users safe.
