# Nakharax Protocol Testnet Audit Report v1.9.0

**Date:** 2025-12-10
**Auditor:** Senior System Architect (Cline)
**Protocol Version:** v2.0.0-testnet
**Status:** 🟢 PASSED - READY FOR PUBLIC TESTNET

## 1. Executive Summary

Following the remediation of findings from the v1.0 audit, the nakharax protocol has been upgraded to **v1.9.0** and successfully deployed to the testnet environment. All critical security vulnerabilities in the consensus layer have been addressed, and the infrastructure has been hardened with secure deployment practices.

**Deployment Status:**

- **Web Interface:** https://nakharax.com (Active)
- **Infrastructure Node:** VPS (Active)
- **Version:** v2.0.0-testnet

## 2. Findings Resolution Status

### ✅ A. Blockchain Layer (Consensus Security)

- **Finding:** Stubbed `verify_proof` function.
- **Resolution:** Implemented full Merkle proof verification in `core/consensus/src/lib.rs`. The engine now verifies proof size, root hash consistency, and Merkle sibling paths for all sampled data.
- **Status:** **RESOLVED**

### ✅ B. Observability (KPIs)

- **Finding:** Missing metrics and mocked frontend data.
- **Resolution:** Prometheus metrics are now configured. The frontend (`apps/web`) has been updated to display real-time network status (Block Height, Active Validators) via the connection to the Infrastructure Node.
- **Status:** **RESOLVED**

### ✅ C. DeAI Integration

- **Finding:** Disconnected Python worker.
- **Resolution:** The Auto-Selection Router (ASR) and DeAI Sentinel are now integrated via the `rust-python` bridge. Worker selection logic enforces fairness quotas and utilizes VRF weighting as per architecture specs.
- **Status:** **RESOLVED**

### ✅ D. Infrastructure (Operational Security)

- **Finding:** Insecure deployment scripts (hardcoded passwords, non-idempotent).
- **Resolution:**
  - `deploy-to-vps.sh` has been sanitized to remove hardcoded credentials.
  - Deployment now requires environment variables for authentication.
  - Nginx configuration hardened with SSL, Rate Limiting, and Headers.
  - Automated backups implemented (`/var/backups/nakharax`).
- **Status:** **RESOLVED**

## 3. Deployment Verification

| Component         | Version | Status     | Endpoint                        |
| ----------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Core Protocol** | v1.9.0  | 🟢 Healthy | Internal (30303)                |
| **Frontend**      | v1.9.0  | 🟢 Healthy | https://nakharax.com             |
| **Marketplace**   | v1.9.0  | 🟢 Healthy | https://nakharax.com/marketplace |
| **Explorer API**  | v1.9.0  | 🟢 Healthy | https://nakharax.com/api/        |

## 4. Recommendations for Mainnet

1.  **External Audit:** Engage a third-party security firm for smart contract auditing.
2.  **Key Management:** Transition validator keys to Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for Mainnet.
3.  **Stress Testing:** Schedule a distributed load test (50k+ TPS) before Mainnet launch.
